      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
      When whitewater rafting, it is important to make sure we're always at our peak when it comes to the safety of our routes so that beginners and experts alike can enjoy their time here.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
      The audience would be anyone interested in whitewater rafting, as well as those who have rafted before and want more challenging rapids. 
      It would probably be best to have an age minimum at 8 or 12. 
      All of these people would have some love of being outdoors and being in the water. 
      People coming to this website would be coming here to view the routes for the rapids, for choosing a route as well as seeing if their planned day would be a good day to go rafting based on water levels and intensity of the rapids.
