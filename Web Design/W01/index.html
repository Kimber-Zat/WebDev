        Who am I?
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a data science major, with hopes to work in database management or something to that degree once I've graduated.
        I play clarinet and video games, and the Zelda series is my favorite of all the video games I've played.

    <p>
        I think learning web design would be super useful for a project I'm working on, building schedules for students at BYU-I.
        I've been a member of the church since birth.
